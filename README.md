# Mcniff Salazar Moisture Sensor

## *Mini-project for Hardware Hacking S2019*

We were tasked to create a mini project using our previous knowledge and components from the term, and construct a new circuit using new component(s).

We wanted to make a soil sensor, and did so using the SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor found here: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/soil-moisture-sensor-hookup-guide?_ga=2.156393023.545380768.1554317640-1658813617.1554317640#hardware-overview-and-assembly
We also were using a Raspberry Pi, Texas Instrument ADS115 ADC, and 7 Segment Display.

We ran into a couple hardware issues, namely loose molex connectors and crossed wires, but overall the project was surprisingly straightforward and rewarding given our previous labs.
